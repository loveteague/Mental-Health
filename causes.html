    <h2>What are some causes of global warming?</h2> 
    
    <p>The burning of fossil fuels has caused warming to pick up significantly more speed in the last century.</p>
    <p>Fossil fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas, and burning them causes what is known as the “greenhouse effect” in Earth’s atmosphere.</p>
    <p>The sun's rays can enter the atmosphere and cause the greenhouse effect when they reflect off surfaces, preventing the heat from escaping back into space.</p>
    <p>The burning of fossil fuels releases gases that keep heat from escaping the atmosphere.</p> 
    <p>Carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons are some examples of these greenhouse gases.</p> <p>Global warming, as the term implies, is the gradual increase in the average world temperature due to excess heat in the atmosphere.</p>
